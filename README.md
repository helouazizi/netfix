# Netfix

## Project Overview

**Netfix** is a Django-based web platform that allows users to request home services and companies to provide them. Services include carpentry, painting, home cleaning, plumbing, and more. The platform supports **two types of users** with distinct roles:

- **Company**: Can create new services.  
- **Customer**: Can request existing services.  

The system calculates total service costs automatically (`hours Ã— price_per_hour`) and displays them in user profiles.
